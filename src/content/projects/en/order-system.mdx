## Project Summary

Order System is a Django-based ecommerce/marketplace project. It focuses on buyer and seller roles with product listings, order creation, sales/spend analytics, and basic financial movements. The project is organized into modular apps for product management, order flow, user profiles, and AI-assisted product/sales recommendations. Payment integration and notification infrastructure are designed to be configurable via environment variables.
