# borsa-v2

borsa-v2 is a Django-based stock and finance analytics web app.

It fetches data via yfinance and renders Plotly charts (candlesticks, volume, and indicators like SMA/EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger). It also includes BIST symbol helpers, pages for analysis/comparison/commodities/forecast/portfolio, plus watchlists and alerts.

Features:
- yfinance data fetch
- Plotly charts (candlestick, volume)
- Technical indicators (SMA/EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger)
- BIST symbol helpers
- Analysis, comparison, commodities, forecast, portfolio pages
- Watchlists and alerts

## Tech Stack
- Django
- yfinance
- Plotly
- HTML/CSS

## Technical Architecture
`Client -> Django Views -> Data Fetcher (yfinance) -> Indicator Engine -> Plotly Charts -> UI`
Watchlists and alerts sit on the data layer.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Data consistency and rate-limit handling
- Accuracy vs performance for indicators
- Chart performance and usability

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual smoke tests for core flows; automation planned
- Logging: Django request and error logs
- Monitoring: Hosting metrics (optional)
