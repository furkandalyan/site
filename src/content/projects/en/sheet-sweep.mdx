# Sheet Sweep

Sheet Sweep (Excel Cleaner) is a desktop app for cleaning and transforming Excel data.

It lets you select columns, remove empty rows, normalize column names, dedupe entries, and standardize date/number formats. Supports batch processing and exports to Excel, CSV, JSON, and SQLite. Also logs all operations and can generate profiling reports with pandas-profiling or sweetviz.

Features:
- Column selection
- Remove empty rows
- Normalize column names
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize date/number formats
- Batch processing
- Export to Excel / CSV / JSON / SQLite
- Operation logs
- Profiling reports (pandas-profiling / sweetviz)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Pandas
- OpenPyXL
- CSV/JSON/SQLite exports

## Technical Architecture
`UI -> Data Loader -> Cleaner/Transformer -> Exporter -> Files/DB`

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Memory usage with large files
- Preserving data types during transforms
- Error handling for batch processing

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual checks with different formats and corrupt data
- Logging: Operation logs and output reports
- Monitoring: Local app, no monitoring required
