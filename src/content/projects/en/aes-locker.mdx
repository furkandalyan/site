# AES Locker

AES Locker is a modern, user-friendly encryption tool for files and folders.

It uses AES-256 encryption with password-protected key files, supports optional RSA hybrid encryption, and offers drag-and-drop GUI, key validity settings, embedding key info into .aesf files, bilingual UI, and built-in RSA key pair generation.

Features:
- AES-256 encryption
- Drag-and-drop GUI
- RSA hybrid encryption option
- Key files (.keyinfo)
- Key validity settings
- Embed key info into .aesf
- TR/EN UI
- RSA key pair generation
- Logging

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- PyCryptodome (AES/RSA)
- OS / Sys (file operations)

## Technical Architecture
`UI -> Encryption Orchestrator -> Crypto Engine (AES/RSA) -> File System`

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Key management and secure key file format design
- Performance and recovery flow for large files
- Clean UX for a security-heavy workflow

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual scenarios (encrypt/decrypt, wrong key); automation planned
- Logging: Operation logs (encrypt/decrypt/error)
- Monitoring: Local app, no monitoring required
