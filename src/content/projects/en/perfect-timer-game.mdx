# Perfect Timer Game

Perfect Timer Game (Tkinter). A precision-based reflex game built with Python and Tkinter.

Your goal is simple: set a target time and stop the timer at the exact moment. No early clicks. No late ones. Just timing mastery.

Features:
- Target time setting
- Millisecond-precision timing
- Clean, focused game loop

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Time Module

## Technical Architecture
`UI -> Timer Engine -> Scoring -> Local Storage`

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Minimizing timing drift
- Non-blocking UI updates
- Fair scoring and feedback

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual scenarios with different target times
- Logging: Basic score/session logs
- Monitoring: Local app, no monitoring required
