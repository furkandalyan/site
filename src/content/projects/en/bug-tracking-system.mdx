# BugTrackingSystem

BugTrackingSystem is a Django-based bug tracking system for reporting, managing, and tracking software issues.

It includes authentication, role-based views (including an admin dashboard), and core workflows for creating, viewing, and updating bug reports. The modular structure keeps the codebase maintainable and easy to extend.

Features:
- User authentication
- Role-based views
- Create / update bug reports
- Listing and detail pages
- Modular bugs app

## Tech Stack
- Django
- Django ORM
- HTML/CSS

## Technical Architecture
`Client -> Django Views -> Issue Workflow Service -> DB`

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Role-based permissions and view separation
- Clean lifecycle states (open/assigned/resolved)
- Search, filtering, and reporting flows

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual access-control and workflow checks; automation planned
- Logging: Django request/error logs
- Monitoring: Hosting metrics (optional)
