# Fast Writing Game

Fast Writing is a typing practice application with a modern GUI.

It helps you improve typing speed and accuracy using randomly selected sentences, real-time mistake highlighting, a best-time scoreboard, and a continuous writing mode.

Features:
- Random sentence practice
- Real-time mistake highlighting
- Best-time scoreboard
- Continuous writing mode

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Time
- Random

## Technical Architecture
`UI -> Input Handler -> Typing Engine -> Metrics/Scoring -> Local Storage`

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- Real-time feedback without UI lag
- Accurate WPM calculation
- Event loop timing and responsiveness

## Testing / Logging / Monitoring
- Tests: Manual scenarios (short/long texts, different speeds)
- Logging: Basic score/session logs
- Monitoring: Local app, no monitoring required
